# SASRec: Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation

I've forked this repo from [here](https://github.com/kang205/SASRec) and updated the code to use TF2 and Python 3. 

The code as it was is in [this folder](https://github.com/woolr/SASRec/tree/master/sasrec_v1), and the updated code is in [this folder](https://github.com/woolr/SASRec/tree/master/sasrec_v2).
